### Step 1: Plant Identification (Plantid-based)


### Step 2: Data Collection from Arduino
Gather environmental data from the plant's surroundings, send the collected data over Serial to be used by the following stages.


**Python Script for Plant Identification and Data Aggregation**

   After collecting the Arduino data (via Serial) and performing plant identification, run a Python script to gather everything and put it in a JSON.

   ```python
   import serial
   import json
   import time
   from plant_identifier import identify_plant  # Custom function from your notebook for plant identification

   # Initialize serial communication with Arduino
   arduino = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600)  # Use the correct port
   time.sleep(2)  # Give time for the connection to stabilize

   def read_arduino_data():
       arduino.write(b"READ")  # Optional: Send a signal to initiate data collection
       temperature = float(arduino.readline().strip())
       humidity = float(arduino.readline().strip())
       pressure = float(arduino.readline().strip())
       return {"temperature": temperature, "humidity": humidity, "pressure": pressure}

   # identify the plant species
   plant_image = "path_to_image.jpg"  
   plant_species = identify_plant(plant_image)  # Plant species name from the model
   
   # Collect environmental data from Arduino
   environmental_conditions = read_arduino_data()

   # Aggregate data into a JSON structure
   plant_data = {
       "plant_species": plant_species,
       "environmental_conditions": environmental_conditions
   }

   # Save to JSON 
   with open('plant_data.json', 'w') as f:
       json.dump(plant_data, f)
   ```

### Step 3: Send Data to LLM and Generate a Care Message


1. **Define the API Request**:

   

   ```python

   import requests
    import json

    # Load plant data
    with open('plant_data.json') as f:
        plant_data = json.load(f)

    # Construct prompt
    prompt = f"""
    Based on the following plant data, provide a care message for the owner.

    Plant Species: {plant_data['plant_species']}
    Temperature: {plant_data['environmental_conditions']['temperature']}Â°C
    Humidity: {plant_data['environmental_conditions']['humidity']}%
    Pressure: {plant_data['environmental_conditions']['pressure']} hPa

    Message:
    """

    # Set up API endpoint and headers for Groq
    api_url = "https://your-groq-endpoint.com/v1/completions"  # Replace with Groq endpoint
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    # Prepare payload
    payload = {
        "model": "groq-llm-model",  # Adjust to your chosen model on Groq
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": 150
    }

    # Send the request to Groq
    response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)

    # Handle response
    if response.status_code == 200:
        care_message = response.json().get("choices")[0].get("text").strip()
        print("Generated Care Message:", care_message)
    else:
        print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
    ```


# **Example Output**:
   Groq might return a response like this:

   ```
   Your Ficus elastica is thriving in its current conditions. Maintain moderate humidity and temperature for optimal growth. Keep the plant in indirect sunlight and water it when the top inch of soil feels dry. To increase humidity, mist the leaves occasionally, especially if the air feels dry.
   ```
